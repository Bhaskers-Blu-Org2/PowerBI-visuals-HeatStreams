Heat-Streams Data Visualization

This is the React component underlying the [PowerBI heat-streams data visualization](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA104381183?tab=Overview).

This data visualization represents quantatitative values over time (or a numeric x domain), per category.
Categories are represented as a row of value boxes. Each box represents the value at that point in time.
